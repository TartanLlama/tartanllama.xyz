I'm Sy.

My background is in developer tooling; I've worked on compilers, debuggers, profilers, language runtimes, standard libraries, IDEs, everything.

I currently work as Microsoft's C++ Developer Advocate.

Some notable projects of mine:

- I wrote the largest resource on debugger implementation, [Building a Debugger](https://nostarch.com/building-a-debugger), which walks you through writing an entire native x64 debugger from scratch
- My implementations of [`std::expected`](https://github.com/TartanLlama/expected) and [`std::optional`](https://github.com/TartanLlama/optional)
- My [C++ ranges library](https://github.com/TartanLlama/ranges)
- I have designed and implemented several esoteric programming languages:
  - [li1I](https://github.com/TartanLlama/li1I): A language where the only valid characters are l, i, 1, I, and whitespace
  - [Enjamb](https://github.com/TartanLlama/enjamb): A poetic language where it's not what's in your lines that matters&mdash;it's where you break them
  - [vizh](https://github.com/TartanLlama/vizh): A visual programming language whose input files are images, ideally created in MS Paint
  - [dwarbf](https://github.com/TartanLlama/dwarbf): A [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter embedded in [DWARF debug information](https://dwarfstd.org/)
  - [elmscrew](https://github.com/TartanLlama/elmscrew): An online visual Brainfuck debugger
- I wrote the recommendation engine for the [arkham.build](https://arkham.build/) deckbuilder for [Arkham Horror: The Card Game](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/)
- I've contributed to several C++ features:
  - [Deducing `this`](https://wg21.link/p0847) (P0847)
  - [`std::views::cartesian_product`](https://wg21.link/p2374) (P2374)
  - [Monadic operations for `std::optional`](https://wg21.link/p0798) (P0798)

I also make [art of various forms](https://sybrand.ink).
